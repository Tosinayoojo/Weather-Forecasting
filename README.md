# Weather-Forecasting
A comprehensive analysis of meteorological data in enhancing weather forecast and accuracy for Sheffield, Uk.

I recently completed a research project focused on the significance of accurate weather forecasting in Sheffield and its impact on stakeholders. Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, I conducted an in-depth analysis of meteorological variables like surface temperature, humidity, and wind speed to create predictive models that serve various local industries, government agencies, and public health sectors.

Key approaches:
- Data Pre-Processing: Structured the dataset for consistency, managed missing values, and ensured integrity by identifying and addressing outliers.
- Model Development: Used historical data to develop time series and machine learning models. For optimal accuracy, the Auto ARIMA model was selected for time series forecasting, while the Random Forest model provided strong predictive capabilities for surface pressure.
- Stakeholder Impact: Our findings offer critical insights that help industries like steel and agriculture, emergency response teams, and local businesses improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

This project underscored the potential of data-driven insights in enhancing resource allocation, managing risks associated with changing weather, and fostering a safer, more adaptive environment for Sheffield residents and businesses.
